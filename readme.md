# 🚀 100-Day Machine Learning Architecture Challenge

**Dive deep into model architectures, from classic MLPs to cutting-edge Transformers, GANs, and Diffusion Models. Code-first approach with daily implementation tasks.**

## 📌 Overview

A structured 100-day journey to **build and understand machine learning architectures** from scratch. No deployment/projects – pure model intuition through code.

**Key Features**:
- 🧠 **Hands-On Implementation**: Code critical components daily (e.g., backprop, attention layers)
- 📈 **Phased Learning**: 5 phases covering Foundations → Generative Models → Transformers → Optimization → Debugging
- 🛠 **Framework Guidance**: NumPy for fundamentals, PyTorch/TensorFlow for complex architectures
- 🔥 **Modern Focus**: Diffusion models, Flash Attention, LoRA, and more

## 🗓 Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Days | Focus | Key Topics |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| 1️⃣ **Foundations** | 1-20 | Classical Models & Neural Networks | Linear Regression, CNNs, MLPs, Data Augmentation |
| 2️⃣ **Generative Models** | 21-40 | RNNs & Generative Architectures | LSTMs, VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models |
| 3️⃣ **Transformers** | 41-70 | Modern Architectures & Efficiency | Transformers, BERT, ViT, YOLO, LoRA |
| 4️⃣ **Optimization** | 71-90 | Training & Speed Hacks | Mixed Precision, Gradient Checkpointing, Quantization |
| 5️⃣ **Analysis** | 91-100 | Debugging & Interpretation | Attention Heatmaps, SHAP, Loss Landscapes |

## 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools

- **Core**: `NumPy`, `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`
- **NLP**: `Hugging Face Transformers`
- **Vision**: `OpenCV`, `TorchVision`
- **Analysis**: `Captum`, `SHAP`, `PyTorch Profiler`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone Repo**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100day-ml-architecture.git
cd 100day-ml-architecture
```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
```bash
conda create -n ml100 python=3.10
conda activate ml100
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

3. **Daily Task Structure**:

- 📖 **Goal**: Implement SGD from scratch

## 🌟 Key Adjustments from Traditional Curricula

| Focus Area | Our Approach | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Foundations** | Prioritized MLP/CNN implementations over clustering | Builds intuition for neural networks |
| **Generative Models** | Integrated diffusion models early | Covers modern SOTA approaches |
| **Efficiency** | Added LoRA, quantization, Flash Attention | Prepares for real-world deployment |
